Project Overview

Description :
-This ambitious project focuses on developing a centralized platform for collecting and storing logs from various DNS servers. Leveraging standard technologies such as Packetbeat, ELK Stack, and MongoDB, we ensure efficient collection, storage, processing, and visualization of DNS logs. The primary goal is to extract relevant information from these logs, enabling the effective identification of attack sources and network anomalies.

Technologies Used :
-Packetbeat
-ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
-MongoDB

Key Features :

-Detection techniques based on Indicators of Compromise (IoC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
-Advanced Packetbeat functionality for capturing DNS traffic data
-Secure and efficient log storage using MongoDB for long-term data management
-Analysis and machine learning techniques for detecting known attack patterns and identifying new attack forms with AI models
